The project consists of two websites: A secure site & a vulnerable site. Both the sites are developed in java for the convenience of the demonstration. Both sites have same look and design, only difference is the way they are coded.

Vulnerable Site
	The vulnerable website has several menus which contain each attack which is possible. This site is demonstration of various vulnerabilities that occur in the websites. By clicking on a menu, a user can try the respective attack, showing them how the attack gets carried out.
	This site is developed in Netbeans IDE.

Secure Site
	The secure website also shows the same menu as the vulnerable site, but this time no attack works. This site makes use of https for security purposes. 
	This site covers all the vulnerabilities and also shows some additional security measures to show secure practice of programming.
	This site is developed in Eclipse IDE. 

Disclaimer : The project can't guarantee that it is 100% secure or flawless as new vulnerabilities are discovered everyday, so it is designed to roughtly give an idea of how things work with respect to the vulnerabilities and how they can be mitigated in easy way
